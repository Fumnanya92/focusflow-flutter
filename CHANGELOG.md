# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased - 2026-01-19

### Highlights

- Friendly Onboarding Improvements
  - Dashboard cards (Focus Session, App Blocking, Tasks) now show a clear "Explored!" indicator when you try them — so you can see progress as you learn the app.
  - When you try all three core features, the dashboard tutorial completes automatically and you are taken straight to the main app view.

- Smarter Back Navigation
  - When you explore a feature and return, the app remembers your place so you can continue the tutorial without getting lost.

- Progress Persistence
  - Your tutorial progress is saved on the device, so you won't lose it if you close or restart the app.

### What this means for you (plain English)
- Easier onboarding: the app clearly shows which key features you've tried.
- Less friction: you won't lose progress when you explore features — the app returns you to the tutorial automatically and finishes it once you've tried the important bits.
- No extra steps: once you've explored the three main features, the app congratulates you and moves you to the main dashboard.

### Bug fixes and polish
- Minor navigation and UI fixes to make the tutorial and dashboard feel smoother.
- Cleaned up behind-the-scenes code to reduce crashes and improve reliability.

### How to get this update
- Android: update from Google Play after the release becomes available.
- iOS: update from the App Store after the release becomes available.
